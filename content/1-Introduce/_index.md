**Backup and Archive Migration with Tiered Storage** focuses on optimizing the backup and data storage process through the implementation of a tiered storage model on the cloud platform. The solution applies Intelligent Tiering to automatically move data between appropriate storage classes, minimizing costs while ensuring retrieval capability when needed.

The project will include the following key components:

Migration Automation – Automating the migration process from the legacy backup system to the new environment.

Tiering Strategies – Developing tiered storage strategies to balance cost, performance, and retrieval time.

Cost Optimization – Analyzing and implementing solutions to reduce long-term storage costs.

Retrieval Procedures – Procedures for fast and accurate data recovery.

Compliance Validation – Ensuring the system complies with data storage and security standards.

Monitoring Setup & Operational Procedures – Monitoring systems and operational processes to ensure stability.

Testing Framework – A testing framework to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the backup/restore process.

The objective of this project is to build an optimized long-term backup and storage system that is cost-effective, meets security and compliance requirements, and offers high scalability and automation.
